# Geo-Spatial Data Mining Using R!

## Abstract 
Geospatial data mining is an important topic with a wide spectrum of applications including traffic safety analysis, disease mapping, and weather forecast. Particularly, Bayesian methods are applied in this field to tackle the point-referenced spatial data. We will show a set of R packages which enable us to conduct analysis using the publicly available US air quality dataset. Spatial data processing, mapping and analysis using R will be presented specifically in this talk. The talk was presented in [Why R? 2020 Conference](https://2020.whyr.pl/).
